Last Tuesday I had my first talk in Stockholm and actually ever in life.

Recently (3 months ago) I moved to Stockholm. Now I work in [0+x](https://0x.se/) as a consultant. And recently I had a chance to participate in local ReactJS meetup organized by 0+x. I was talking about type checking Javascript statically.

I want to thank [@nipher_jonas](https://twitter.com/nipher_jonas), [@WayeBenjamin](https://twitter.com/WayeBenjamin) and Maria Verbenko for help and support.

Here I'd like to share the link to event recording and slides:

Also this article is basically a text version of the talk - [Do You Need Static Type Checking?](http://localhost:8000/posts/static-type-checking-js/)
