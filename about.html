<h1>Hey, Nice To Meet You!</h1>
<section>
<p>My name is Maksim Ivanov, I'm 27 years old and have a dog and two cats and I'm <strong>addicted to programming</strong>.
</p></p>

</p>
<p>First thing that I <strong>developed was a small game</strong> about a mouse trapped inside a maze. I'm not sure if that project could be qualified as a game, because there really was no way to win it, you could only fall into a trap or catch a bullet and the level would start over.ðŸ˜….</p>
<p>During my school years <strong>I used to help my classmates with our computer science classes</strong>. And in my spare time I developed small flash games.</p>
<p>When it was time to select a university <strong>I chose the one that was closest to my mother's house</strong>. It was State Marine Technical University. At that moment, I was already working as a programmer in a small team developing casual games for social networks. As I wasn't really interested in getting a degree â€“ I would often skip classes and as a result I <strong>dropped out during my third year of education.</strong></p>
<p>It didn't upset me, because <strong>I was finally able to focus on programming</strong> and building my software development career.</p>
<p>Since then I worked in several great companies, met lots of amazing people and developed all kinds of software from browser and mobile games, to web applications and video streaming services.</p>
<p><strong>Today I would love to help you with your programming career.</strong></p>
<p>In this blog I share tips, tricks and <strong>useful tutorials</strong> on modern frontend technologies.</p>
<p><strong>Feel free to join my mailing list</strong> where I share even more great stuff and I will never-ever send you spam.ðŸ˜‰</p>
