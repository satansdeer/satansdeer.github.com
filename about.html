<h1>Hey, Nice To Meet You!</h1>
<section>
<p>My name is Maksim Ivanov, I'm 27 years old and have a dog and two cats and am <strong>addicted to programming</strong>.

<p>First thing that I <strong>developed was a small game</strong> about mouse trapped inside the maze. I'm not sure if that project could be qualified as a game, because there really was no way to win it, you could only fall into a trap or catch a bullet and the level would start over.ðŸ˜….</p>
<p>During school years <strong>I was helping my classmates with our computer science classes</strong>. And in my spare time I was developing small flash games.</p>
<p>When it was time to select the university <strong>I chose one that was closest to my mothers house</strong>. It was State Marine Technical University. At that moment I was already working as a programmer in a small team developing casual games for social networks. As I wasn't really interested in getting a degree â€“ I would often skip classes and as a result I <strong>drop off during my third year of education.</strong></p>
<p>It didn't upset me, because <strong>I was finally able to focus on programming</strong> and building my software development career.</p>
<p>Since then I worked in several great companies, met lots of amazing people and developed all kinds of software from browser and mobile games, to web applications and video streaming services.</p>
<p><strong>Today I would love to help you with your programmers career.</strong></p>
<p>In this blog I'm sharing tips tricks and <strong>useful tutorials</strong> on modern frontend technologies.</p>
<p><strong>Feel free to join my mailing list</strong> where I share even more great stuff and never-ever send spam.ðŸ˜‰</p>
