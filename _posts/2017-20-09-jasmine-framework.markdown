_Psst, do you write javascript that runs in browser?_ I have something for you, it's&nbsp;called&nbsp;__Karma__, you'll like it.

When you write javascript code, you have to test it. The same code might work slightly differently in different browsers, so you better test your code at least in most common of them.
