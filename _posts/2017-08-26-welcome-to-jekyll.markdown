Everything is a system.
Big systems consist of smaller ones.

Some systems have its own economy.
Similar goods can have different price in different economical systems.
Every imbalance of this kind is an arbitrage opportunity.
Arbitrage allows to get this difference between costs of some kind of goods in different systems.
Examples: different bitcoin exchanges, SEO and websites. Even more, it can be people who value time vs people that value money.
